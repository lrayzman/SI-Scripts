--- OVERALL INSTALLATION STEPS ---

- Install Visual Studio 2010 Express
- Install Windows 7.1 SDK
    - Ensure x64 bit compiler tools are all selected (yes, by default)
    - Uninstall MIcrosoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributables that may be installed.
      The SDK install conflicts with newer version of redistributable and may fail
      during the installation process. Subsequently install the latest version
      of the redistributable over the one installed by the SDK
    
- Set up a release compilation environment for the SDK by adding the following 
   shortcut in the Start->All Programs->Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1
   (You can use the Debug shortcut and just modify it to create a release one)

   C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /E:ON /V:ON /T:0E /K "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows   \v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /Release

- If properly set up when in Scilab the following commands should show as
  haveacompiler -> T
  findmsvccompiler -> msvc100express


- VC++ needs to be configured for x64 compilation. Make sure to select proper configuration.
  To set up: right click on the Project in the Solutions Explorer tab
  Configuration Properties -> Platform Toolset -> Windows7.1SDK 
  If only vc100 or vc90 are available then SDK is not set up properly


--- SOURCE FILES ---
 
  Source files of interest under SparamToolbox directory

  \src\c                   - read_tchstn and write_tchstn low level functions source and supporting file
  \src\c\MainCodeRead      - VC++ project and driver/test code for testing read_tchstn function
  \src\c\MainCodeWrite     - VC++ project and driver/test code for testing write_tchstn function
  \src\c\ErrorHandlerTest  - VC++ project and driver/test code for testing the error handler
  \sci_gateway\c           - Scilab gateway sources for read_tchstn and write_tchstn 
  \help\en_US              - XML files containing the help man
  \tests                   - Scilab code examples for sptlbx_readtchstn and sptlbx_writestchstn


--- GENERAL DEBUG STEPS ---

- To debug read_tchstn  or write_tchstn  use the VC++ projects along with the driver test functions
- To debug gateways generally have to rebuild in scilab.  There is no debugging capability other 
  than debug messages. 

--- AUTOMATIC TOOLBOX LOADING ---

- For automatic loading of the toolbox add the following line to loader.sce
  located in SCI\contrib  directory


     exec(SCI+"\contrib\SParamToolbox\etc\"+"SParamToolbox.start");
